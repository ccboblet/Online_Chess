TRACK PIECE MOVEMENT
Create an array of positions. Look up piece position everytime a move is made.
Generate the array in load pieces function.
Store in a piece object in a board object.

Function: Load Pieces
Link image with a square
Edit child or innerhtml?
Child is more modular (don't need 1 long string)
Create unique id based on starting square (id doesn't need to mean anything to a human)

Create object linking square with image
loop through the object
create an image element
create a unique id based on the starting square
append each image to the square
create a piece object with id and current square (also need piece type)
add piece object to board object

I can track the square a piece moves to. How do i want to record piece type in relation to piece id
